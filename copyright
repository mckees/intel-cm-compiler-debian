 On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General

# Please also look if there are files or directories which have a
# different copyright/license attached and list them here.
# Please avoid picking licenses with terms that are more restrictive than the
# packaged work, as it may make Debian's contributions unacceptable upstream.

#   /usr/share/debhelper/dh_make/licenses/
